# OpenSourcePsychology
The goal is to use Machine Learning to take in a user's thoughts and feelings, and recommend quotes or ideas from books based on what "disorders" the user may be experiencing

The key idea behind this is that there is no "catch all" cure to any one mental health issue, and many people find solutions in hearing other people's experiences. We believe that the way Mental Disorders is viewed in psychology is not condusive to the recovery of sufferers. The core assumption that we are making is that reading about people with similar problems will vastly aid the recovery from problems people have, as long as ease some of their existential burden.

The ML Model should be able to corelate an app user's experience with the wealth of experiences shared online, and not only diagnose them (without regards to the field of Pyschology), but also provide them with short quotes or testimonials that they may relate to based on the ML-diagnosis.
